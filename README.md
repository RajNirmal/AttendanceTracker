<h3>What is special?</h3>
<p>Nothing much actually</p>
<ul>
  <li>An app lock kind of implementation which will ask you to enter a passcode everytime you open the app</li>
  <li>An interactive map to show exactly how far you are away from the zone</li>
  <li>Auto log off after 7 hours or user walks out of campus</li>
